// scala is too intelligent to understand the data type.
// It is not necessary to define the data type

var num = 8
var str = "coffee"

// in to order call the values declared before, we can us $ symbol in front of the declared name along with a s at first

println(s"$num times he had his $str")

// we can het boolean results by using {} in the print statement

var x=10
println(s"checking the value if it is ${x==10}")

// printing the refernced, formatted, raw and tab values respectively 

val y = 2.704

println(s"the value is : $y")
println(f"the value is : $y%.3f")
println(raw"the value is\t: $y")
